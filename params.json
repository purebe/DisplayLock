Occasionally, I have need to keep my computer on all night and it's annoying waiting for the display to automatically turn off when I head for bed.  With this program, I simply run it and can rest assured knowing my computer is both locked, and not ruining my sleep by illuminating the room.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any trouble or problems or ideas when using DisplayLock, feel free to contact me at john_conder9@mymail.eku.edu and I'll try to get back to you!"}
